#### My name is Jan. Good to see you.

I am a Software-Engineer from the very north of Germany. Most of my experience lies in agile full-stack development. Within that field I tend to focus on backend and architecture topics. I am passionate about snappy and modern applications on the web and mobile devices as well as using cloud services to promote their performance and resource utilization.

- ⚓️ Here are some technologies I've utilized to some degree:
  - 🖥 Frontend:
    - React.js, React Native, Vue.js
  - 🚀 Backend:
    - Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, Laravel, Go Gin, Go Fiber, Spring Boot
  - 🚜 Infrastructure:
    - AWS, Azure, Serverless, Docker, Docker-Compose, Terraform, GH Actions
- 🌱 I’m planning to learn these technologies next:
  - Flutter
  - Rust
